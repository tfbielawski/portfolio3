                        Marine Corps veteran, and former law enforcement agent 
                        turned software engineer with 2 years of experience in web 
                        and mobile app development.

                        <br></br>
                        My software development experience includes: working on a multi-state, 
                        non-profit educational web application with C#/.NET, Blazor, and Cosmos db, 
                        and building and customizing more than 30 React Native Android and iOS
                        mobile apps from a central “core” repository using xCode and Android Studio.

                        I also have experience in Agile methodology, Jira workflow ticketing, 
                        Github version control, and I'm familiar with some CI/CD concepts. I'm a 
                        strong communicator, I work well in teams, I'm good under pressure, and I have 
                        strong customer service skills. I’ve proven my willingness to accept roles 
                        outside of my area of responsibility in previous roles, demonstrating my ability  
                        to learn new technologies and languages in which I had no training or experience.

                        with my software development skills, I'm ready to become a valuable 
                        addition to a great development team.

                        I've served in many places in this country and around the world 
                        with people from all walks of life during my 19 years as a law 
                        enforcement officer and as a Marine.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        I've also completed two, year-long deployments to Afghanistan 
                        as an embedded civilian Law Enforcement Professional with our military forces. 
                        I have a DoD Secret clearance (now inactive), and worked closely with
                        our intelligence and operational forces overseas, demonstrating my
                        trustworthiness and reliability.
                        The work I did as a civilian Law Enforcement Professional in the 
                        Afghanistan battlespace is one of my proudest professional accomplishments.

                        My personal grit and determination to succeed helped me earn my AS 
                        degree in computer science and a diploma from full-stack 
                        development bootcamp at age 47. I am neither afraid of challenges 
                        nor of persevering through uncomfortable situations to achieve my goals.
